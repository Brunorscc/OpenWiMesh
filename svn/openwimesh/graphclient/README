- GraphClient can be compiled using both its "Netbeans" project (./nbproject dir)
and its "Qt Creator" project (GraphClient.pro file and .pro.user file, 
both used by qmake).
- The Makefile in the root path is a file produced by Netbeans. To compile 
using the Netbeans project by the command line just run
> make 		# from root path.

- To compile using Qt Creator project just run:
#(optional, just if any project modification or graphics interface files modifications)
> qmake GraphClient.pro -r -spec linux-g++-64 
> cd ../qt-Release #(or "../qt-Debug")
> make
